`cloninator` is a command-line tool that enables you to clone all your repositories based
on a configuration file. This configuration file is located at `~/.config/cloninator/config.yaml`.
If you need to split the configuration across multiple files,
`cloninator` can read all `yaml` files located in the `~/.config/cloninator/config.yaml.d/` directory.
